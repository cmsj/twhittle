This is a daemon that deletes your oldest tweets, but there are two huge limitations:
 * You can't get API keys for this stuff from Twitter anymore, so unless you already have one, move on.
 * The Twitter API only lets you get your most recent 200 tweets, so use some other method to nuke yourself down to <= 200 tweets, then this daemon will keep you in the 150-200 range.

You probably don't want any of this, but I do, so yay.
